The bin/ and lib/ directory have been created with "make chroot dist-ccu-step1". The
directories contain the Python binary and some selected modules which have been extracted
from a Debian wheezy chroot.

These files have been commited to the git to make automatic build possible without creating
the chroot for each build.
