# Since no encoding is set in CCU environment the Python interpreter
# sets sys.stdout.encoding to ANSI_X3.4-1968 which makes print() fail
# with an UnicodeEncodeError when trying to print unicode strings.
#
# This is a small wrapper which enforces the encoding of stdout,
# stderr and stdin to be UTF-8.
