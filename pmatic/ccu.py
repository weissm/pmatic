    access to all kind of entities like devices, channels, parameters, rooms
    and so on. It is possible to either poll information from the CCU or
    wait for incoming state update events provided by the CCU.

    If your program is executed right on the CCU, you don't need to provide
    any of the optional arguments.

    The optional arguments *address* and *credentials* are needed if you execute
    your program not on the CCU. You need to provide the host address of the
    CCU, which can be an IP address or resolvable host name as *address* argument.
    The *credentials* need to be given as two element tuple of username and password,
    for example ``("admin", "secretpw")`` which are then used to access the CCU.

    The default TCP connect timeout for the HTTP requests to the CCU is set to
    10 seconds. If you like to change the timeout, you need to set the argument
    *connect_timeout* to a number of seconds of your choice.

        In this mode the scripts are not executed as separate process, but in the context of the
        pmatic manager. This mode has been implemented to provide direct access to the already
        fully initialized CCU() object off the pmatic manager. So scripts can access all devices,
        channels, values etc. without the need to fetch them on their own from the CCU. This makes
        running scripts running a lot faster while producing a very small load.

        This method makes it possible to use regular pmatic scripts which create their own
        CCU object and connect to the CCU on their own when run as dedicated programs within the
        contxt of the pmatic manager and use the CCU object of the manager when executed in
        "run inline" mode.

        But this only works as intended after the connection of the manager with the CCU has been
        initialized. So better not use the "on startup of manager" condition for this.

        Additionally the device objects are cached in the centrall :class:`.pmatic.CCU` object for
        later reference, when e.g. another search is asking for the same device. In
        case the same object is returned.

        The object can be filtered using different filter parameters.

        The *device_type*
        can be used to either search for devices of one specific or multiple types. The
        device type needs to be given as string which needs to be the exact product name,
        for example ``device_type="HM-Sec-SC"``. If you want to get multiple device types,
        you can do it like this: ``device_type=["HM-Sec-SC", "HM-CC-RT-DN"]``.

        You can also search for specific devices by their names. The first option is to
        search for the exact name of one single device by setting the *device_name* to the
        name of the device, for example: ``device_name="Wohnzimmer-Fenster"``. Please note
        that this filter is case sensitive and a full exact match for the device name.

        If you need more flexible filtering by the name, you can use the *device_name_regex*
        filter. You can either provide a regex in form of a string which is then matched
        with the device name from the start of the name (prefix match).
        One example to match all device names ending with *-Fenster*:
        ``device_name_regex=".*-Fenster$"``.
        You can also provide the result of :func:`re.compile` as value of *device_name_regex*.
        This is useful if you want to specify some special regex flags for your matching regex.

        The *device_address* can be used to get a specific device by it's address. This is an
        exact match filter. So you can either get a device collection of one device or an empty
        one back.
